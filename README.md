# CarPredictionModel
This is a simple python machine learning that I developed as a personal project. This model takes past car purchase data and uses variables like average income, average debt, gender, age etc. to predict the price at which any given person will purchase a new car. This project was developed in python and implemented python libraries such as pandas, keras, seaborn.
